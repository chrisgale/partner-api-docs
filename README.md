## Contributing


### Running locally

    bundle install
    bundle exec jekyll serve

## ToDo's (should probably raise as issues)

- Add linting, plus everyting else a good repo should have (Contributing md file) - Run past forkability
- Wire up CI, Travis or Circle, for auto build on change
- Add Google Analytics
- Update examples to be valid dates etc
- Make live code examples
- Check email links are all correct
- Rework DE pages to so they are a language switch on the EN pages. Also need 100% coverage

## Scibbles so they don't get lost
