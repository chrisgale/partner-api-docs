<h2 id="what-is-hxapi-">What is HXAPI?</h2>
<p><strong>HXAPI</strong> allows you to interact programmatically with the Holiday Extras reservation and product information systems.</p>
<p><strong>HXAPI</strong> improves upon our earlier <a href="http://www.holidayextras.co.uk/affiliates/xmlintro.html">XML feed</a> and grants live access to our product library. Using <strong>HXAPI</strong> you can include our products in your booking flow, whilst keeping the customer within your site and the appearance of only one transaction.</p>
<p>You can use <strong>HXAPI</strong> whether your Holiday Extras account is Intermediary or Retail.</p>
<p>In general the procedure has three basic types of request:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Availability</strong></li>
<li><strong>Product library</strong> - Detailed information about products.</li>
<li><strong>Booking</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The fields required for each request differ according to product.  The products and endpoints for these products can be found in the Endpoint/type reference section.</p>
<h2 id="what-s-in-a-request-">What&#39;s in a request?</h2>
<p>We have built <strong>HXAPI</strong> according to REST design principles. All that means is that everything is done using standard HTTP, just like a web browser. There are no complicated protocols, no specialist skills needed by your programming team. If you would like to read about REST design, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">here is a good primer</a>, but it does assume some programming knowledge.</p>
<p>Your application sends in HTTP requests and receives a response. The HTTP method used determines the type of action.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>GET</strong> The most common, this will <strong>retrieve</strong> information from the specified URL (eg an availability request, or product library).</li>
<li><strong>POST</strong> This will be creating a new something, most often a booking.</li>
</ol>
<p>By default the response from <strong>HXML</strong> is XML, but other formats (YML, CSV, TXT, JSON) are available. How to specify the format is detailed in the <a href="/intro">technical documentation</a>.</p>
<h2 id="restrictions-of-use">Restrictions of use</h2>
<p>We monitor usage of HXAPI and ask that all applications behave responsibly. Any application producing a volume of requests which we judge to be excessive will have its account suspended.</p>
<p>The requests to our system should only be sequential as we allow only 4 requests at exactly the same time.</p>
