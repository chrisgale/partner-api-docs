# Hotel Booking

As with all bookings, this must be a POST and it must be made over HTTPS. Intermediaries will be sending credit card information, Agents will send their login details so HTTPS is required in both instances.

If you do not send the ABTANumber field then your booking will not be tracked to your agent code. For agent bookings, the Password field is also required, intermediaries do not have a password.

To retrieve all details about the booking, perform a [GET request to view the booking](hxapi/viewamendcancel) at the location specified in `<MoreInfoURL>`.

Currently, we can only accept 2 rooms per booking. If the customer needs more, you will need to make multiple requests. If an intermediary account, this would lead to multiple transactions on the credit card, and multiple charges, therefore we advise against it. Agents accounts do not suffer from this, they can make multiple requests as they process the payment themselves.

## /hotel/foo

e.g. /hotel/LHRSOF

#### Terms and conditions Holiday Extras GmbH, Munich

Please us the following link to display terms and conditions to the end consumer or agent. http://www.holidayextras.de/images/de-hx/pdf/agb.pdf
For further languages please change /de-hx/ into nl-hx, it-hex, en-hx, pt-hx, fr-hx, es-hx.

PriceCheckFlag and PriceCheckPrice are used to ensure that the price you have displayed to the customer at the availability stage will be booked at that price.  When you submit the request the price posted here will be compared to the live price in the system.  If the price is lower in the system the booking will be made as the customer will benefit from a saving.  If the price has changed and is higher than the price stated on availability, an error will return to explain that the price has increased, the booking can still be made but the customer must confirm that they will pay the higher amount.  You should then resubmit the request changing the PriceCheckPrice with the new price.  At this time the system will also update any availability cache so subsequent availability requests will then have the updated price.
