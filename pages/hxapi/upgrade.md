### Pricing

It may be easier to assume all passengers/rooms on the bookings would like the addon, and this is permitted though not recommended. You should calculate and present prices based on the 'Per' flag and user input. Limit the quantity of per room & per person addons based on the Adults, Children & number of rooms sent, and per booking addons to 1.
