# User Token

[API Docs](hxapi/) > endpoint:[usertoken](hxapi/usertoken)

Any request to **HXAPI** for either availability or to make a booking must include a valid user token. Your application should obtain a new user token for every user who embarks on an availability search. Once a user has made a booking, we expect the user token to be dropped, **it should not be reused**.

This is not intended as a mechanism for identifying returning users. If you require that functionality, your application should handle it separately.
