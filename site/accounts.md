# Integration Process

We aim to make the process for partners integrating with our API straightforward, by following these simple steps:

1. Create an account;
2. Kick off call;
3. Development phase;
4. Certification;
5. Go live.

More details on each of these phases can be found below.

## 1. Account Creation

Before you can start interacting with our API, you must apply for a *retail agent API account*, even if you are already working with us. This involves completing the following three forms:

1. [Sign Up Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd1H4fp744DNt8mzwKt-7bh_xer3N2JbIHhNLRgUHwf2r9GZw/viewform?usp=sf_link)
2. [Self Bill Agreement](http://secure.holidayextras.co.uk/images/apiForms/SelfBillv3.pdf)
3. [Direct Debit Mandate](http://secure.holidayextras.co.uk/images/apiForms/DDebitMandate.pdf)

NB: If you are a European partner, you will need to contact our [European Partnerships team](<hxapi-contact@holidayextras.de>) for a SEPA mandate.

When completed, all forms should be sent by email to <sales@holidayextras.com>

We will then send to you your account details and any further instructions for getting started.

## 2. Kick off call

Once your account has been created you will be assigned an Account Manager, who will support you throughout the integration process. The initial contact with your Account Manager will be either a conference call or face to face meeting (whichever is most practical), which will cover the following elements of your integration:

- Overview of our API
- Security and authentication
- Infrastructure
- Performance
- API features and workflow
- Support

More details can be found in the [kick off document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dL6kF3_hpBIKeXeEUkehR22geAhpazD8V58EVSRrUKo/edit).

## 3. Development phase

During the development phase, your Account Manager will be contactable to answer any queries you may have.
