#### CarPark/RequestFlags

Flags listing which details the car park operator requires from the customer. If a flag is returned with a 'Y' your application should send the corresponding field/value in the booking request.

The flags which can be returned are:


*  Registration

*  CarMake

*  CarModel

*  CarColour

*  OutFlight

*  ReturnFlight

*  OutTerminal

*  ReturnTerminal
