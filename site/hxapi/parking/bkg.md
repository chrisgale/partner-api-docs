# Make booking at car park

[API Docs](/hxapi/) > product:[Parking](/hxapi/parking) > endpoint:[carpark](av) > [Make Booking](bkg)

This must be a POST, as you are making a booking. It must be made over HTTPS. Intermediaries will be sending credit card information, Agents will send their login details so HTTPS is required in both instances.

If you do not send the ABTANumber field (for agent code) then your booking will not be tracked to your agent code. For agent bookings, the Password field is also required, intermediaries do not have a password.


To retrieve all details about the booking, perform a GET request to view the booking at the location specified in `<MoreInfoURL>`. [Instructions on how to view a booking](/hxapi/viewamendcancel/view).

# Post-booking

For parking products, once the booking has been made, you should include a barcode on your confirmation page and email. This is a simple representation of the booking reference and it just involves another call to the api. Details are available [here](http://docs.holidayextras.co.uk/doku.php?id=hxapi:barcode).

## /carpark/foo

where foo is the carpark code

e.g. /carpark/LHR2

### Method

POST

### Parameters

#### Intermediary

We no longer accept card payments taken via the API - this will be updated to include a TOKEN to pass in payment.
A new API service will be availble to obtain a token from a Credit Card number - you must prove that you are PCI compliant before this service is available for you.

#### Terms and conditions Holiday Extras GmbH, Munich

Please us the following link to display terms and conditions to the end consumer or agent. http://www.holidayextras.de/images/de-hx/pdf/agb.pdf
For further languages please change /de-hx/ into nl-hx, it-hex, en-hx, pt-hx, fr-hx, es-hx.

PriceCheckFlag and PriceCheckPrice are used to ensure that the price you have displayed to the customer at the availability stage will be booked at that price.  When you submit the request the price posted here will be compared to the live price in the system.  If the price is lower in the system the booking will be made as the customer will benefit from a saving.  If the price has changed and is higher than the price stated on availability, an error will return to explain that the price has increased, the booking can still be made but the customer must confirm that they will pay the higher amount.  You should then resubmit the request changing the PriceCheckPrice with the new price.  At this time the system will also update any availability cache so subsequent availability requests will then have the updated price.

If the price has changed and is higher than the price stated on availability, an error will return to explain that the price has increased, the booking can still be made but the customer must confirm that they will pay the higher amount.  You should then resubmit the request changing the PriceCheckPrice with the new price.  At this time the system will also update any availability cache so subsequent availability requests will then have the updated price.
