# Integration Process

We aim to make the process for partners integrating with our API straightforward, by following these simple steps:

1. Create an account;
2. Kick off call;
3. Development phase;
4. Certification;
5. Go live.

More details on each of these steps can be found below.

## 1. Account Creation

Before you can start interacting with our API, you must apply for an *API account*, even if you are already working with us. Please complete the [sign up form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd1H4fp744DNt8mzwKt-7bh_xer3N2JbIHhNLRgUHwf2r9GZw/viewform?usp=sf_link), which is automatically submitted to us upon completion.

You are also required to submit one of the following finance forms to us, depending on your region and the products you intend to integrate for:

- For UK Partners only, non-insurance products: [Direct Debit Mandate](https://github.com/holidayextras/partner-api-docs/blob/master/site/hxapi/NEW%20DD%20MANDATE%20RBS%20HX.pdf)
- For UK Partners only, insurance products: [Direct Debit Mandate](https://github.com/holidayextras/partner-api-docs/blob/master/site/hxapi/NEW%20DD%20MANDATE%20RBS%20INS.pdf)
- For European Partners only: [SEPA Mandate](https://github.com/holidayextras/partner-api-docs/blob/master/site/hxapi/SEPA%20Basislastschriftmandat.pdf)

Once all the information has been received, we aim to set up the account within 48 hours (if submitted at weekends or bank holidays, this will not be processed until the following working day).

When completed, all forms should be sent by email to our [UK](mailto:sales@holidayextras.com) or [European](mailto:hxapi-contact@holidayextras.de) Partnerships teams (depending on your region). We will respond with your account details and any further instructions for getting started.

## 2. Kick off call

Once your account has been created you will be assigned an Account Manager, who will support you throughout the integration process. The initial contact with your Account Manager will be either a conference call or face to face meeting (whichever is most practical), which will cover the following elements of your integration:

- Overview of our API
- Security and authentication
- Infrastructure
- Performance
- API features and workflow
- Support

More details can be found in the [kick off document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dL6kF3_hpBIKeXeEUkehR22geAhpazD8V58EVSRrUKo/edit).

## 3. Development phase

During the development phase, your Account Manager will be contactable to answer any queries you may have.

Once we are satisfied that your integration meets the requirements in the certification check, then we will open your account up to our production systems.
